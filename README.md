# OAK


OAK is a student-developed version control system project at NITK. It provides local version control capabilities without the need for installation.

## Getting Started

To access the OAK project, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/darknight26/git-proj.git
```

Once you have the code on your local machine, you can navigate to the project directory.

## Running OAK

OAK can be run directly from the command line or terminal. Here are the available commands:

```
oak init                # Initialize a new OAK repository
oak add <file>          # Add a file to the repository
oak commit "message" # Commit changes to the repository
oak log                 # Display commit history
oak status              # Show the current status of the repository
```
